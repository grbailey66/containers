## Infrastructure and operations leaders responsible for the data center should:

* Create a container platform strategy that applies best practices across security, governance monitoring, storage, networking, container life cycle management and container orchestration.
* Start with small, simple use cases; ensure that containers are stateless and immutable; and enforce standardization, automation and federation of clusters for easier management and rapid scalability.
* Integrate container as a service or platform as a service platforms with continuous integration/continuous delivery, security and operational tools; if needed, then augment it with best-of-breed tooling that enables I&O to meet business SLAs and simplify developer workflow.
* Create a platform ops team that works with application developers for platform selection and operations and is focused on continuous improvement to meet the required business SLAs of production applications.
